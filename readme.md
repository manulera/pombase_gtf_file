# PomBase GTF file

A script to convert pombase gff3 file into GFT format compatible with transvar.

## Requirements for running using docker

You need to have docker installed. Then simply run: `bash run_with_docker.sh`

That will download some files (see `get_data.sh`).

The output gtf file will be at `data/pombase_genome.gtf`.
